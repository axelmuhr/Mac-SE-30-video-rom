# Mac SE/30 video rom
 This  is the disassembly of the Macintosh SE/30 video declaration ROM done by me.
 It will be used as a codebase for a series of posts on www.geekdot.com to expain how Macintosh decalration ROMs work and how to write your own.

 Until these posts are done, not much is happening here.
